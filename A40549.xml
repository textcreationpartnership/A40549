            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Courant, for which Glorious Atchievment, their Imperial Majeſties attended by all the Nobility of that Court, paid their Devotions in the Cathedral of St. <hi>Stephen,</hi> where <hi>Te Deum</hi> was Sung (with a Royal <hi>Salvo</hi>) of a Triple Diſcharge of all the Canon upon the Ramparts, continued by Vollies of Muſquets, Reſounding with Ringing of Bells, Bonefires, and Acclamations of the People; the ſame being brought the Emperor from the Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> by General Count <hi>Taaffe,</hi> ſince the diſpatch of Prince <hi>Eugine</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to conſerve the Method of acquiring this mighty Action, 'tis neceſſary at firſt to know the Inducement that oblig'd the <hi>Grand Vizier</hi> to quit his Impregnable Retrenchment, and give Battle to the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> on the 27th. the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> paſſed the <hi>Drave</hi> with his Army, and Fortified his Camp near <hi>Darda,</hi> with two Modern Retrenchments in the Front, ſtrengthned with <hi>Palliſados,</hi> having <hi>Eſſeck</hi> and the <hi>Drave</hi> in his Rear, the <hi>Danube</hi> and the <hi>Moraſs</hi> on his right, with a Wood and a <hi>Moraſs</hi> on his left; which being view'd by the Generals, 'twas judg'd Impoſſible without hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Ruine of the whole Army, to attaque and force his Camp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'twas reſolv'd by ſome Stratagams of War, to draw the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> from thoſe ſecured Retrenchments, ſo March'd and Counter-march'd the Army in divers Figures, one Detatchment of them making ſhew as if they would repaſs the <hi>Danube</hi> at <hi>Mohaez,</hi> and go into high <hi>Hungary,</hi> whilſt another made a feigned movement, of Marching towards <hi>Sygeth</hi> and <hi>Sycloſs,</hi> not without being able ſuddenly to re-unite their Main Body, which the <hi>Turks</hi> perceiving, look'd upon it at firſt, as really it was intended, to decoy him out of his Poſt; and thereupon would ſcarce permit the Ravaging <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> to pick up ſome of our <hi>Forrigers,</hi> till believing they might be retreating in earneſt, made ſome Detatchments to obſerve the Countenance of our Army, and ſometimes Skirmiſhed with our advanced Guards, gave us the Alarm; and having taken 200. of our Men, return'd to the Camp (fluſhed with this advantage) the <hi>Turks</hi> began to ſhew themſelves in different Parties; our Generals contrived new Methods, Marching their Armies in ſeveral Fronts further afield, as well to be diſtant from a Wood, which incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our <hi>Foragers,</hi> as to give the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> a larger ſpace of Ground with deſire to follow us; But this March was yet in vain, yet notwithſtanding, the ſame day we perceived a conſiderable Body of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalry in our Rear; But ſo ſoon as we faced about, and began to Skirmiſh with them, they made a haſty Retreat: The Duke of <hi>Lorain,</hi> by this time, judging that he ſhould not be able to cauſe him to give Battle in open Field, took a reſolution to March for <hi>Sycloſs</hi> and <hi>Five-Churches,</hi> and withdraw thoſe Garriſons, Demoliſhing the Fortifications, which otherwiſe might have fallen into the Enemies poſſeſſion, began to move towards them on the 10th. and with eaſie Marches, continued the 11th. ſending Baron <hi>De
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:109089:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>Orlick</hi> to precede the Vant-Guard with 4 or 500 Horſe; In this March, a great Body of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Spahies did what they could to interrupt our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhewing themſelves ſometimes on the Wing, then on the Flanks; We enter'd upon Diſpute with them, but they Retired with recipitation: On the Twelfth, the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> thinking the <hi>CHRISTIANS</hi> were making the beſt of their way from him, would not looſe the opportunity, but detach'd ſome of his beſt Troops, to give us a Diverſion; and about two in the Afternoon 10000 <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Cavalry, and half the number of <hi>Janizaries</hi> came right upon our Left Wing, Commanded by the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> preceded by ſome <hi>German Curiaſiers,</hi> who vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly ſuſtain'd the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Charge, but retir'd into their firſt Line: on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain The <hi>Janizaries</hi> were Poſted on an Eminence, with ſome Field-Pieces, and made continual Firing with ſmall Shot, whilſt 10000 of their Horſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to put us in Diſorder, which oblidg'd the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to extend his Front to be in proportion with that of the Enemy, the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Comercy</hi> ſuſtain'd this firſt Charge, which was very fierce and obſtinate; the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> continuing firm with great Reſolution and Courage, notwithſtanding they were Attaqu'd in Front and Flank, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector came in Perſon to their Aſſiſtance, and found the Diſpute ſo warm, that he received a Shot in his Hand, Prince <hi>Comercy</hi> a Wound in the Breaſt with an Arrow, which yet did not hinder his continuing in the Action, to give what neceſſary Orders were requir'd.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorain</hi> to get ground, cauſes at the ſame time, the Right Wing to March croſs, and ſtretch towards the Flank of the Enemies, who Attack'd on the Left, and the Left went to meet another Body of Horſe and Foot which March'd to Charge them, and now the Fight began to be bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on both ſides, the Victory hanging in ſuſpenſe for two or three hours; but by the coming in of a freſh Detachment on the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſide, the <hi>Turks</hi> began to loſe ground, afterwards to mend their pace; and in the end, to take a perfect Flight. One Body of their Cavalry relying upon their Foot, put the whole in diſorder; a great Slaughter being made, and we purſu'd the Enemy with ſo much Rigour and Heat, that we enter'd Pell Mell into their <hi>Camp;</hi> and made our ſelves with little reſiſtance, Maſters of both the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchments, and purſued the Enemy as long as the day would permit. This Victory is ſo great, as not to have any parallel for ſome Ages: We drove many into the <hi>Moraſs</hi> and <hi>Drave,</hi> where they periſhed; the Bridge over the River, through the weight of People thronging to get over, broke down; ſome ſay the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> caus'd the ſame to be done, leaving a multitude on this ſide the <hi>Drave,</hi> who are retir'd to the <hi>Woods, Marſhes,</hi> and <hi>Iſles,</hi> where they are ſhut up: and muſt Surrender upon diſcretion, for want of Food: And ſome Perſons report that there is no leſs than 25 or 30000 Men thus di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd. And of 15000 old <hi>Janiſaries,</hi> ſcarce 50 are ſaved; and they reckon above 20000 are Kill'd and Drown'd. They have Seiſed a mighty Rich Booty, the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi>'s Tent, which is fell to the Lot of the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> is ſo Rich in <hi>Gold, Pearl, Precious Stones,</hi> &amp;c. as is ineſtimable. 116 <hi>Cannon,</hi> and <hi>Mortars</hi> taken, 6000 Head of Cattle, 1500 <hi>Camels,</hi> an hundred <hi>Buffulors</hi> ſeized 2000 Waggons with Proviſion and Ammunition, are fell into our Hands, a number of Tents, Standards, and Horſes Tails, and there is ſcarce a Souldier but abounds in Gold and Silver. The Priſoners alſo Report, that the Grand <hi>Vizier</hi> had not been induced to come out of his Retrenchments, but by the Perſwaſion of ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in his Army, who Flatter'd him with aſſurance of Succeſs; and that they ſhould certainly take Priſoners the Dukes of <hi>Lorain</hi> and <hi>Bavaria;</hi> and thereby oblige the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour to make Peace with the Grand <hi>Seigneur,</hi> and reſtore all the places in <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> he has Conquer'd during the War: But Providence has diſpos'd other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and 'tis not to be doubted, but that this Glorious Victory will have a quite contrary Effect.</p>
